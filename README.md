## Anatomy of a denosaur

No 2 dinosaur look the same, the visual element combined with it's name is required to really capture it's personality.

example: 
```json
{
  "name": "Denver",
  "img": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/master/topics/deno/deno.png"
  "id": "cc3ac624-a239-48b8-b5cd-d842560d950e"

```
